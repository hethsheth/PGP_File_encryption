PGP encryption or Pretty Good Privacy encryption, is a data encryption computer program that
gives cryptographic privacy and authentication for online communication. It is often used to
encrypt and decrypt texts, emails, and files to increase the security of emails.
In the 1990s, normal email communication wasn’t a very secure way to communicate. Any
packet that gets sent across the internet transits through networks that are beyond our control.
It can be intercepted and tampered with, all without you or the recipient’s knowledge.
Increasing use of electronic communication had led to calls for reliable authentication and
security services. These dangers are part of why PGP was developed by Phil Zimmermann in
1981 - to bring some semblance of privacy and security to email communication for the general
public.
PGP encryption uses a mix of data compression, hashing, and public-key cryptography. It also
uses symmetric and asymmetric keys to encrypt data that is transferred across networks. It
combines features of private and public key cryptography. Each step uses a different algorithm.
Today, PGP has been standardized into OpenPGP, enabling anyone to write PGP software that is
compatible and interoperable with other platforms that use PGP. Several OpenPGP-compliant
developer libraries have been created to help programmers implement PGP encryption in their
applications.
PGP mainly offers the following services:
● Authentication
● Confidentiality
● Compression
● E-mail Compatibility as well as segmentations
